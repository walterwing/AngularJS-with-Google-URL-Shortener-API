# AngularJS-with-Google-URL-Shortener-API

Brief Introduction

This serverless single-page application (SPA) supports generating short URL based on a specified URL. After signing in with Google account, the users can create their own specific short URLs, and they can even check statistical information of the URLs they had generated, like the creation time of a short URL, and how many times the URL had been clicked since after that.

The magic behind this application is Google Shortener API:
